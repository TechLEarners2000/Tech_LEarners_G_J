# TechLEarners Website (scaffold)

This repository contains a minimal Next.js scaffold and Tailwind configuration created as project files only (no npm commands were run).

Quick start (on your machine):

```cmd
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- Tailwind is configured in `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`.
- Global styles are in `styles/globals.css`.
- A basic `Navbar` and `Footer` component live in `components/`.
- Add your `public/logo.svg` or replace the placeholder.

Next steps I can do for you:
- Run `npm install` and scaffold full node_modules / run dev (if you want me to run commands).
- Add more pages and components (Services, Projects, About, Contact).
